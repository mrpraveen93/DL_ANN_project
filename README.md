# DL_ANN_project
This project applies an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the compressive strength of concrete using its material composition. Factors like cement, water, aggregates, and admixtures influence strength. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates concrete strength from these input features.
